## P02 - Linear Search - Using Json and Getch
### Alexander Dela Cruz 
### Description: 
Program uses json to read in from a dictionary with an algorithm that looks for a term user inputs and if theres
only 1 match prints the definition (couldn't figure out enter key ;-;)

### Files
|   #   | File            | Description                                        |
| :---: | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | Main.cpp        | Main program that runs     |
|   2   | loadJsonEx.hpp  | loads in json from library          |
|   3   | ./data/dictionary.json | json object with terms and definition |
|   4   | ./headers/animals.hpp| File contains animal names|
|   5   | ./headers/console.hpp| File contains console functions and determines which libraries to use based on your OS|
|   6   | ./headers/json.hpp| File allows the usage of json files|
|   7   | ./headers/rang.hpp| Provides a namespace for coloring text in the terminal|
|   8   | ./headers/timer.hpp| This is a simple class that wraps the "chrono" data type and allows a user to time code snippets at the granularity of seconds or milliseconds|


### Instructions
- Make sure to have all headers and data in the right folders
- Program prints out instructions :P
